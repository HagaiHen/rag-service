# üß† RAGify - Lightweight RAG Service with FastAPI, FAISS, and OpenAI

**RAGify** is a minimal and powerful **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** service built with **FastAPI**, **FAISS**, and **OpenAI API**.
It allows you to **upload PDF or CSV documents, store them as vector embeddings locally using FAISS, and chat with them using OpenAI's GPT models.**

## üöÄ Features

- Upload and parse **PDF** and **CSV** files.
- Embeds documents using **local SentenceTransformer (MiniLM-L6-v2)** or **OpenAI Embeddings**.
- Stores vectors efficiently using **FAISS local index**.
- **Chat** with your documents using **OpenAI GPT models (like GPT-3.5-Turbo)**.
- Lightweight and privacy-friendly (documents never leave your machine).
